###### Overview of the MDM
MDM is a way to ensure employees stay productive and do not breach corporate policies. Many organizations control activities of their employees using MDM products/services. MDM primarily deals securing emails, securing corporate documents on devices, enforcing corporate policies, integrating and managing mobile devices including laptops and handhelds of various categories. 
MDM implementations may be either on-premises or cloud-based.

###### Implementation
Typically solutions include a server component, which sends out the management commands to the mobile devices, and a client component, which runs on the managed device and receives and implements the management commands. 
In some cases, a single vendor provides both the client and the server, while in other cases the client and server come from different sources.

###### What is KNOX
- Samsung Knox is an enterprise mobile security solution.
- Samsung Knox provides security features that enable business and personal content to coexist on the same handset. The user presses an icon that switches from Personal to Work use with no delay or reboot wait time.

- The Knox service is part of the company's "Samsung Approved For Enterprise" (SAFE) offerings for smartphones and tablets. 
- Samsung Knox's primary  competitor is Blackberry Balance, a service that separates personal and work data. 

e-fuse
Samsung Knox devices use an e-fuse to indicate whether or not an "untrusted" (non-Samsung) boot path has ever been run. The e-fuse will be set if the device is booted with a non-Samsung boot loader, kernel, kernel initialization script or data. Rooting the device and installing a non-Samsung Android release will therefore set the e-fuse. Once the e-fuse is set, a device can no longer create a KNOX Container, or access the data previously stored in an existing KNOX Container.[7] This information may be used by Samsung to deny warranty service, in the United States, to devices that have been modified in this manner.[8] This is the case even though, in the United States, voiding of consumer warranties in this manner may be prohibited by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975, at least in cases where the phone's problem is not directly caused by rooting.[9] For some devices it is possible to clear the e-fuse by flashing a custom firmware.[10]
